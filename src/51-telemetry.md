### Telemetry Ltd, London

When I joined Telemetry, the infrastructure team maintained an environment that resembled a continuous raging fire, not helped by the code drops from developers accompanied with minimal support or explanation.  'On call' entailed a seven day marathon of not sleeping with an ingrained expectation to still show up for a nine till six work day.  The group was demoralised and exhausted.

I taught the group how to evolve our stack to make everyone's lives better.   With their access to servers and source code they could make those necessary improvements themselves.  Working with the developers we improved their design decisions and the programming skills of my system administration team.   With that skill set overlap, developers and infrastructure members started working together more effectively and pro-actively sought advice from one another.

During my time there I changed the responsibilities of the team to include assisting others in their work and building fast and dirty prototypes to get projects back on track.  We were described as  'working magic'.

As well as maintaining a $500k budget and handling contract negotiations with providers I built new products to test in the market; TLM, SiteDNA and Plan Blue which made its first $1m within six months.

I was Telemetry's primary investigator for fraud, handling the discovery, identification, filtration and working with journalists at the Financial Times, Businessweek, Ad Exchanger and Advertising Age to put together articles about my work; work that directly led to winning new business.
