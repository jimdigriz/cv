### School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), London

 was hired by SOAS to form a two person infrastructure team that would maintain the Cisco based network infrastructure and the handful of Linux systems it had deployed.

Shortly after I joined, SOAS embarked on an infrastructure refresh programme to migrate to a 'L3 to the edge' and 802.1X capable wired network that included the roll out of an [eduroam](https://eduroam.org) wireless service.  Working with my line manager and a colleague, we did the initial design, configuration templates, tendering for a supplier and then forklift upgrade of the Cisco switching fabric.  The network had since continued to meet our needs as our requirements for quick fail over, higher throughput, multicast and production IPv6 deployment have grown.

Whilst there, and due to my involvements with eduroam, 802.1X and FreeRADIUS I was invited to be a member of the JANET Campus Networking Special Interest Group (DOT1XSIG) and in the past helped as an adviser for the JANET Wireless Technology Advisory Service (WTAS).

#### Projects and Presentations

 * [LanWarden](https://webmedia.company.ja.net/content/documents/shared/networkshop080408/clouter-lanwarden.pdf) - an in house framework that uses FreeRADIUS with LDAP to make 802.1X/MAC-auth policy decisions
 * [IPTV rollout](https://www.soas.ac.uk/itsupport/iptv/) - replaced an analogue service, bringing 70 television and 15 radio foreign satellite broadcasts to every desktop
 * [Anycast'ing Enabling of Services](https://github.com/jimdigriz/ospf-ha-anycast) - brought high-availability to services (eg. DNS) without adding the complexities, expense and single point of failure that load-balancers can bring
 * [DNS Hijacking and IP Blackholing](https://github.com/jimdigriz/network-layer-protection) - made the network infrastructure another layer of protection for our users from downloading infectious payloads and phishing attacks whilst also providing the network team an easy way to discover the many instances that anti-virus software had failed
 * [SLACCers](https://github.com/jimdigriz/slaacer) - IPv6 Accountability without DHCPv6
 * [DNS Servers, the More the Merrier](https://webmedia.company.ja.net/content/documents/shared/networkshop300310/clouter_dnsserversthemorethemerrier.pdf) - Why You Need More Than Two
